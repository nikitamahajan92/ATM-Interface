# ATM-Interfafce
I'm excited to share a recent task I completed that involved enhancing an ATM program in Python. In this task, I focused on improving the code structure, readability, and user experience.

# Key Enhancements:

**Refactored Code:** I refactored the code to improve its structure and readability, making it easier to understand and maintain.

**Added Descriptive Messages:** I included descriptive messages before each operation to guide users through the ATM options more clearly, enhancing the user experience.

**Improved Return Messages:** The return messages of each method now provide a clearer indication of the outcome of the operation, ensuring users are informed about the success of their actions.

**Enhanced Separation:** I added separation lines after each operation to improve the visual organization of the console output, making it easier for users to follow along.

**Support for Multiple Users:** I expanded the program to support multiple users by adding additional accounts with unique account numbers, PINs, and balances.

I'm proud of the improvements made to this project, as they not only enhance the functionality of the ATM program but also improve the overall user experience. If you'd like to learn more about the project or discuss potential collaborations, feel free to reach out to me.
